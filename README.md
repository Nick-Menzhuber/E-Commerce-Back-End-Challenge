## Installation 

This is not a deployed application. In order to use the code, clone the repo and install dependencies (npm i). Create a .env file, using the example .env file in the repo as a template. Be sure to enter your MySQL shell to source the schema file and set the correct database (ecommerce_db) for use. Then exit the MySQL shell and run the seeds file (npm run seed) and start the server with nodemon (npm run watch)!



## Usage 

Utilize Insomnia to see how the application is able to get data about products, product categories, and product tags. A video demonstration is available here: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/i3bX14Nm6whbfN6AbmR8
